# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 2026**

Random Access Labs ("we," "us," or "our") operates several digital products, including the mobile game **SYLO** and the web utility **QRido**. This policy outlines how we handle data across all our services.

### 1. Our Philosophy
We believe in "Zero Draft" development, which extends to privacy. We do not collect personal data unless it is absolutely necessary for the core functionality of the app. 

### 2. Data Collection
* **SYLO (Mobile Game):** We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). Game progress and high scores are stored locally on your device. We do not use third-party tracking or analytics SDKs.
* **QRido (Web Utility):** We do not collect, store, or share the data you input into our QR generator. All processing happens locally in your browser or is handled as a stateless request. 

### 3. Third-Party Services
While we do not collect your data, the platforms we use to distribute our apps (Apple App Store and Google Play Store) may collect diagnostic data, such as crash logs or device identifiers, to help us maintain app stability. We recommend reviewing their respective privacy policies.

### 4. Children’s Privacy
Our apps are intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

### 5. Australian Privacy Compliance
As an Australian entity, we adhere to the Australian Privacy Principles (APP). You have the right to inquire about any data we may hold (though, as stated, we aim for zero data retention).
